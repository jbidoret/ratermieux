Samuel Beckett gave permission to Mabou Mines to stage The Lost Ones through the playwright Jean Reavey, who was a close friend of the author, on the condition that it was only a "straight reading". During rehearsals, the reading expanded into a fully realized production directed by Lee Breuer with David Warrilow performing the text in a dark, foam rubber cylindrical space with tiny HO scale plastic figures and ladders. The music was composed by Philip Glass. Beckett later wrote to Reavey, "Sounds like a crooked straight reading to me."
