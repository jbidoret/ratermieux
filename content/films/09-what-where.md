# What Where

<video controls src='https://ubu.com/media/video/Beckett-Saumuel_What-Where_Film-Documentary.mp4'></video>


In Samuel Beckett’s What Where four disembodied faces engage in a cycle of interrogation and torture. Its treatment of this subject matter makes it one of Beckett's most overtly political works.

What Where was originally written for the stage and was adapted by Beckett for German television. Walter D. Asmus, who was assistant director to Beckett in adapting the work, is the director of this new production. Asmus brings an intimate understanding of the process that Beckett went through in adapting the work and has been crucial in making this the first English language version that is faithful to the original vision that Beckett had for bringing What Where to the screen. This new production of What Where also represents a significant technical updating of the original version with new production techniques adding subtleties and dimensions to the work that were not achievable with the technology that was available when What Where was first adapted for the screen.

Includes the documentary The Remaking of What Where which offers insights into the adaptation of the original stage play and the making of this new production of Beckett's work.
Walter D. Asmus worked as an assistant director to Samuel Beckett on a total of nine stage and television productions between 1975 and 1986 and has directed all of Samuel Beckett’s plays in productions that have toured the world. He has an unparalleled understanding of Beckett’s directorial vision and is widely regarded as one of the preeminent directors of Samuel Beckett’s work.
