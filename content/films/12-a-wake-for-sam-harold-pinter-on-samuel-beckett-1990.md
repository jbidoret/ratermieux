Duration: 12:00

As part of a BBC tribute to Samuel Beckett, A Wake for Sam broadcast a series of personal reflections on the Nobel laureate, alongside television productions of his work. Here is playwright and poet Harold Pinter's contribution to the programme: 'Less than two months after Samuel Beckett’s death on 22 December 1989, Harold Pinter recorded the below memoir of the dramatist under the title “A Wake for Sam.” Pinter shares his memories of his first meeting with Beckett, reads a short appreciation, and finally recites the conclusion of The Unnamable.'
