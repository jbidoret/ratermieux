Flute – Edward Beckett  
Gong, Written-By – Samuel Beckett  
Harmonium – John Beckett  
Narrator – Jack MacGowran  
Recorded By – Malcolm Eade  

MacGowran in his time was the foremost interpreter of Beckett’s work, and the recording sessions were personally supervised by Beckett. Beckett’s nephews played programme music on organ and flute, and Beckett himself banged a gong. MacGowran’s voice is a beautiful instrument, and he plays perfectly on it the absurdly tragic humour of the author.  

The music played is Quartet in D minor by Schubert.  

Recorded under personal supervision of Samuel Beckett.
