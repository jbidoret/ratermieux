Marin Karmitz Filmed French adaption of Beckett's play, 'Play'. With El\u00e9onore Hirt, Michael Lonsdale and Delphine Seyrig Samuel Beckett's COMEDIE (PLAY) was first staged in Berlin in 1964 and subsequently in London and Paris. In the same year, Beckett met Marin Karmitz, a 24 year old film director, and they agreed to make a film of COMEDIE with the original cast, Michael Lonsdale, El\u00e9onore Hirt and Delphine Seyrig. Beckett and Karmitz were together for a year, talking, drinking a great deal and engaging in an experiment to regress to the moment of their birth, to experience the primal scream. At the end of this period the film was made. Karmitz had already made a short film with Marguerite Duras. This extraordinary work amply demonstrated his phenomenal skills with extremes of black, grey and white and a heightened sensitivity to concurrences of visual and verbal language. These concerns were totally in tune with Beckett's own. Beckett's stage directions for COMEDIE with rapid-fire speech and instantaneous lighting switches from character to character could be realised with much greater precision through the medium of film. It seems he was not happy with the speed the actors were able to deliver the lines in the theatre. In the film version, voices are speeded up to a point of near indecipherability (without altering their tonality) developing an electric intensity that is complemented by the extraordinary lighting and camerawork. Beckett was involved in every stage of the production of the film and was enthusiastic about the result. COMEDIE was screened at the Venice Film Festival in 1966. Rediscovered this year, it is apparent that not only is it a masterpiece but also a remarkable precursor of some of the internationally celebrated film and video work that artists have made in the last few years.

This light illuminates an actress's mouth. The mouth utters a monologue of fragmented, jumbled sentences which gradually coelesces into a narrative about a woman who has suffered an unpleasant experience. The title comes from the character's repeated insistence that the events she describes did not happen to her. The stage directions also call for a character called 'the Auditor' who wears a black robe and can be dimly seen at the back of the stage, occasionally raising its hands in a gesture of impatience. When Beckett came to be involved in staging the play, he found that he was unable to place the Auditor in a stage position that pleased him, and consequently allowed the character to be omitted from those productions. However, he did not decide to cut the character from the published script, and whether or not the character is used in production seems to be at the discretion of individual producers. As he wrote to two American directors in 1986: \"He is very difficult to stage (light--position) and may well be of more harm than good. For me the play needs him but I can do without him. I have never seen him function effectively.\" -- Wikipedia \"Not I\" Not I By Samuel Beckett Written in English in spring 1972. First performed at the Forum Theater of the Lincoln Center, New York, in September 1972. First published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1973. First performed in Britain at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 16 January 1973. Note: Movement: this consists in simple sideways raising of arms from sides and their falling back, in a gesture of helpless compassion. It lessens with each recurrence till scarcely perceptible at third. There is just enough pause to contain it as MOUTH recovers from vehement refusal to relinquish third person. Stage in darkness but for MOUTH, upstage audience right, about 8 feet above stage level, faintly lit from close-up and below, rest of face in shadow. Invisible microphone. AUDITOR, downstage audience left, tall standing figure, sex undeterminable, enveloped from head to foot in loose black djellaba, with hood, fully faintly lit, standing on invisible podium about 4 feet high shown by attitude alone to be facing diagonally across stage intent on MOUTH, dead still throughout but for four brief movements where indicated.

This light illuminates an actress's mouth. The mouth utters a monologue of fragmented, jumbled sentences which gradually coelesces into a narrative about a woman who has suffered an unpleasant experience. The title comes from the character's repeated insistence that the events she describes did not happen to her. The stage directions also call for a character called 'the Auditor' who wears a black robe and can be dimly seen at the back of the stage, occasionally raising its hands in a gesture of impatience. When Beckett came to be involved in staging the play, he found that he was unable to place the Auditor in a stage position that pleased him, and consequently allowed the character to be omitted from those productions. However, he did not decide to cut the character from the published script, and whether or not the character is used in production seems to be at the discretion of individual producers. As he wrote to two American directors in 1986: \"He is very difficult to stage (light--position) and may well be of more harm than good. For me the play needs him but I can do without him. I have never seen him function effectively.\" -- Wikipedia \"Not I\" Not I By Samuel Beckett Written in English in spring 1972. First performed at the Forum Theater of the Lincoln Center, New York, in September 1972. First published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1973. First performed in Britain at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 16 January 1973. Note: Movement: this consists in simple sideways raising of arms from sides and their falling back, in a gesture of helpless compassion. It lessens with each recurrence till scarcely perceptible at third. There is just enough pause to contain it as MOUTH recovers from vehement refusal to relinquish third person. Stage in darkness but for MOUTH, upstage audience right, about 8 feet above stage level, faintly lit from close-up and below, rest of face in shadow. Invisible microphone. AUDITOR, downstage audience left, tall standing figure, sex undeterminable, enveloped from head to foot in loose black djellaba, with hood, fully faintly lit, standing on invisible podium about 4 feet high shown by attitude alone to be facing diagonally across stage intent on MOUTH, dead still throughout but for four brief movements where indicated.

This invaluable resource, which includes contributions from dramatist Martin Esslin and performances by Billie Whitelaw and Ronald Pickup, was created for the BBC as part of The Lively Arts series in 1977. Both Ghost Trio and ...but the clouds..., originally written for television, receive their world premiere in this fascinating documentary which also explores Beckett\u2019s personal life and work in detail, highlighting his interest in portraying characters who are never quite able to express their emotions. Ghost Trio is a television play, written in English by Samuel Beckett. It was written in 1975, taped in October 1976 and the first broadcast was on BBC2 on 17 April 1977 as part of the Lively Arts programme Beckett himself entitled Shades. Donald McWhinnie directed (supervised by Beckett) with Ronald Pickup and Billie Whitelaw. The play's original title was to be Tryst. \"On Beckett\u2019s notebook, the word was crossed out vigorously and the new title Ghost Trio written next to it. On the title page of the BBC script the same handwritten title change can be found, indicating that it must have been corrected at the very last minute. ... but the clouds ... is a television play by Samuel Beckett. Beckett wrote it between October\u2013November 1976 \"to replace a film of Play which the BBC had sent [him] for approval (and which he had rejected)\" due to \"the poor quality of the film\".

This invaluable resource, which includes contributions from dramatist Martin Esslin and performances by Billie Whitelaw and Ronald Pickup, was created for the BBC as part of The Lively Arts series in 1977. Both Ghost Trio and ...but the clouds..., originally written for television, receive their world premiere in this fascinating documentary which also explores Beckett\u2019s personal life and work in detail, highlighting his interest in portraying characters who are never quite able to express their emotions. Ghost Trio is a television play, written in English by Samuel Beckett. It was written in 1975, taped in October 1976 and the first broadcast was on BBC2 on 17 April 1977 as part of the Lively Arts programme Beckett himself entitled Shades. Donald McWhinnie directed (supervised by Beckett) with Ronald Pickup and Billie Whitelaw. The play's original title was to be Tryst. \"On Beckett\u2019s notebook, the word was crossed out vigorously and the new title Ghost Trio written next to it. On the title page of the BBC script the same handwritten title change can be found, indicating that it must have been corrected at the very last minute. ... but the clouds ... is a television play by Samuel Beckett. Beckett wrote it between October\u2013November 1976 \"to replace a film of Play which the BBC had sent [him] for approval (and which he had rejected)\" due to \"the poor quality of the film\".

The scripts dramatize (comically and/or tragically) the relative merits of life and death, at times sardonically questioning if oblivion supplies a sufficiently comforting state of grace. Yes, life is miserable, solipsistic, and mechanical, but might it turn out that living is a less painful condition than dying? It is a matter of belief\u2014lingering amid (or despite) the confusion remains the only option for characters in various conditions of dissolution, nothingness nipping at their heels. Of course, Beckett\u2019s genius as a writer is to generate a sometimes contemplative, sometimes slapstick poetry out of this uncertainty over the compensatory value of our ultimate end. What directors Peter Brook and Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne bring to their vision of the plays is a beautifully modulated theatricality and rich humanity that gives life a fighting chance, though they wisely eschew easy sentimentality.

Productions of Rough for Theatre I, which features a troubled encounter between a blind man and a guy in a wheelchair, usually turn the pair\u2019s awkward attempt to forge a friendship in some sort of nether world into a cruel farce. Here the match-up is cantankerous, lively, and even touching until the ending. Beckett has one of the characters simply wrench a pole from the other\u2019s grasp; in this production, the gesture raises the possibility of assault. Fragments is filled with surprising squibs of self-destruction and hostility, wit and nostalgia, acceptance and rebellion. The production\u2019s trio of accomplished performers supply the demanding physical and vocal dynamics with ease; my major reservation is that Yoshi O\u00efda\u2019s accent makes it difficult to make out his words, particularly in Rough for Theater I. His clowning is agile in Act Without Words II, his short-tempered frustration shading nicely into fervent prayers for deliverance from the life cycle. Carmichael\u2019s vocal nuances are silky and supple; she even overcame a ringing cell phone the night I attended to present a remarkably poignant Rockaby. She also comes up with a tart Neither, a Beckett libretto that I have not seen before. Bruce Myers shifts his ground effortlessly, moving from commanding to craven with a flick of his torso or alternation in his tone of voice. Brook and Estienne take no liberties with the words in the texts, though changes in the staging have been made for the sake of dramatic flair. Rough for Theatre I calls for a wheelchair, but here it is a cloth-covered platform on wheels. Rockaby is written as a duet between a live performer (who is supposed to look \u201cprematurely old\u201d) and a recorded voice\u2014but Carmichael\u2019s agile vocal gear shifting more than compensates for ditching the recording. Come and Go gives us Myers and O\u00efda in drag, joining Carmichael on a bench, three aging women gossiping about the ravages of time. I have never seen this piece done with such an infectious sense of fun\u2014it is usually an exercise in the funereal. The popular caricature of Beckett is that his work is dessicated and off-putting, experimental and difficult.

Yet the playwright\u2019s painstaking art asks that the audience take pains as well, which makes it radical. Today, too much theater embraces the noisy and obvious, reveling in the delusive, futuristic spell cast by the visceral and the visual, which spoon feed the audience what it supposedly needs to know or feel. We are not encouraged to work very hard or draw on our imaginations\u2014the primal fear is that, if challenged, we will change the channel or our allegiances in an increasingly competitive entertainment market place. Theater-as-event doesn\u2019t offer a strong alternative to the reign of a media-crazed cultural machinery apparently bent on helping to dissipate meaning and value from human existence. The difference is between theater that respects theatergoers as thinking human beings or placates them as consumers representative of demographic niches.

It includes the American version of Not I that was filmed in 1989, performed by Margo Lee Sherman and directed by Larry Sacharow. Not I is a thirteen-minute dramatic monologue that was written in 1972 and premiered that same year at the Forum Theatre, Lincoln Center, New York. In 1975 Samuel Beckett made a television version for the BBC, performed by Billie Whitelaw and directed by Bill Morton. In Not I a human mouth floats in the darkness, lit by a single beam of light and filmed in close up. It recites a fragmented monologue made up of syncopated phrases about an individual with a distressing past. Although the voice is female (performed by an actress), the text does not specify whether it is a man or a woman. The title is taken from the voice\u2019s repeated insistence that the events she describes did not happen to her. The television adaptation of the theater piece decisively influenced the work. For technical reasons, in the television version Becket eliminated a second character (of indeterminate gender) who had acted as a silent receiver in the original theater piece. On the stage, the audience saw a woman reciting a monologue, but on the screen viewers see only a mouth, an element that becomes autonomous, emphasizing its status as a physical organ. The lips of the actress maintain their original state, but they also become a sphincter and a vagina. The monologue is spoken very rapidly, broken by desperate outbursts of laughter and shouts: an incandescent mouth that speaks about itself in third person while repeatedly denying its identity. Although cinema is one of Beckett\u2019s lesser known facets, his forays into film are by no means peripheral within his body of work, and they have influenced contemporary visual artists such as Bruce Nauman and Sol LeWitt, among others. Beckett began to take an interest in the use of radio and television in the mid-sixties. Over a period of more than two decades, he wrote and produced one film (Film, 1964) and seven works for television, and made a film adaptation of his theatre piece Not I. In all these works, he continued the formal quest that had driven his playwriting, for \u201cthe strangeness and beauty of the pure image.\u201d Voir sur UbuWeb","title":"Peephole Art"},{"location":"films/21-peephole-art-beckett-for-television-not-i-1988-1989-1992/#peephole-art-beckett-for-television-not-i-1988-1989-1992","text":"A documentary that contains three performances of Samuel Beckett\u2019s works written or adapted for the small screen: Not I, Quad I & II and What Where.

In Searching for Sam: Adrian Dunbar on Samuel Beckett (BBC Four), the actor we know and love as Superintendent Ted Hastings follows the reportedly too-small-shoe\u2019d footsteps of his great hero. It was Beckett\u2019s play Waiting for Godot that changed Dunbar\u2019s life while a drama student, he says, so this is something of a personal quest. Go on, Dunbar, call him \u201cfella\u201d! But Dunbar is too reverential for that. \u201cI\u2019ve often heard people say Beckett\u2019s work is difficult and bleak, but that\u2019s not true for me,\u201d he says, over images of Beckett looking, as one contributor memorably says, like an \u201cAztec eagle\u201d. \u201cI find engaging with Beckett\u2019s work both life-affirming and uplifting.\u201d Beckett was at school in Dunbar\u2019s home town, Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Although they never met, Beckett\u2019s life, says Dunbar \u2013 who has a lovely turn of phrase \u2013 \u201cwhile elusive, is still within touching distance\u201d. And so he tracks down the \u201cdwindling number\u201d of people who knew him, and follows him from Dublin to Paris, then on to the village of Roussillon, where Beckett and his partner Suzanne fled from the Nazis. Like one of the long walks into the hills Beckett used to take with his father, it covers a lot of ground, but not a huge amount of depth. There is no doubt it must be hard to make a documentary about a man so private and ambiguous, but much of it feels frustratingly shallow. Explanations are unforthcoming, which I guess Beckett would have approved of. Godot \u201crevolutionised drama for ever,\u201d says Dunbar, but it is not explained how or why. The film seems to rely on a lot of prior knowledge of Beckett\u2019s work, which may be fine for many BBC Four viewers, but not all (and not this one). Dunbar is an engaging guide, but his enthusiasm sometimes trips him up \u2013 at one point, he says he feels as if he is prying, but a bit more prying is what this documentary could do with. Or a bit more levity (yes, I know we\u2019re talking about nihilist Beckett here). Take it from the man himself. Stephen Rea, one of the \u201cinner circle\u201d of Beckett actors, says: \u201cHe never ever talked about meaning. He only talked about adding more humour.\u201d Dunbar doesn\u2019t always pull at interesting threads, either. Beckett falls in love with his first cousin. \u201cYou have to wonder what effect falling in love so close to home did to him,\u201d says the historian and writer Diarmaid Ferriter, but he isn\u2019t pushed on a theory. Beckett\u2019s biographer, James Knowlson, says: \u201cWhen he wrote about that, it really caused something of a rift with his family.\u201d But what did he write? We are never told. But in many places it is illuminating \u2013 there is curious stuff about his relationship with his mentor and kind-of boss James Joyce \u2013 and its sense of place is rich and evocative. Dunbar starts in rainy Dublin; Beckett grew up in an affluent Protestant suburb, largely shielded from the poverty in the city. He was expected to be a servant to the empire, go into the church or the army, perhaps, brought up with an ethos \u201cof Christian, civic responsibility\u201d, although, of course, he rejects this. I\u2019m a sucker for specifics, and here it works best when the excavation of Beckett\u2019s life is linked to his work. So his difficult relationship with his mother is illuminated by the mother-child dynamic in his works Company, and The End, and her death is fictionalised in another play. But it\u2019s frustrating when the influence of Beckett\u2019s experiences are hinted at but not explained. \u201cWhat do they see on their journey?\u201d asks Ferriter about Beckett and Suzanne\u2019s fleeing Paris for the French countryside. \u201cWhat kind of landscape is that? Does that find its way into later work? I think it certainly does.\u201d Dunbar doesn\u2019t ask for, or offer up, an example. Still, the longer the film goes on the more I like Dunbar, walking the streets in his leather jacket, and his opinions. Talking about the impact of grief \u2013 both he and Beckett lost their fathers fairly young \u2013 he says: \u201cPain makes you articulate,\u201d but grief does the opposite. \u201cWomen bond face-to-face,\u201d he opines, but men, talking about the father and son\u2019s long walks, \u201cbond shoulder to shoulder\u201d. Beckett\u2019s war years are portrayed as the making of him: he joins the resistance, working as a translator (he was \u201ca terrible shot\u201d), before he and his partner Suzanne are forced to run away once his cell is broken. What a life. In Normandy, he volunteers for the Irish Red Cross, working as a translator, driver and rat-catcher. \u201cIt seems to me that after the second world war, Beckett finally realised he had something to write about,\u201d offers Dunbar. There is, says Ferriter, \u201cinternalised trauma\u201d and you don\u2019t need to be a Beckett scholar to know that it did influence his work. \u201cHe saw the world as a place of great suffering,\u201d says actor Barry McGovern. Back in Paris, Beckett locks himself away for a couple of years and creates three novels and \u201cthe play that would change everything\u201d \u2013 and no, I still don\u2019t understand what that really means.

It is presented by renowned Irish actor Stephen Rea who has a special affinity with Beckett's work and was closely advised by Beckett on a number of productions in the 1970s and 1980s. He is joined by the great Billie Whitelaw , Beckett's leading lady for over 25 years, often regarded as a medium for his work. In the programme she recounts that while not understanding the plays intellectually she feels them very strongly emotionally. When she runs through the lines, it's Beckett's own voice and rhythm she hears: \"Nobody reads those words like Sam does\". Beckett premiers were memorable events for directors. The first English performance of Beckett's notorious Waiting for Godot was directed in 1955 by Sir Peter Hall , then aged only 24, who recounts the commotion in the theatre on the first night, and his personal difficulties in getting to grips with this work: \"It's a new voice, a new language... it changed me in understanding that less is more... it changed my life completely\". Actor Lawrence Held found Beckett's directing to be unusual, but inspiring: \"Very strict, very precise, and almost balletic at times ... in Godot he approached me about the end of the first act when the moon rises and he said \"next time talk with the tone of moonlight in your voices\", and we understood exactly what he meant\". Using these specially recorded interviews, Beckett and his Actors gives the listener an opportunity to get closer to the mind of Beckett, to be in the room with him as he directs, and gives a personal insight into one of the great figures of 20 th century art. Krapp's Last Tape A new radio production of Krapp's Last Tape by Samuel Beckett, starring Corin Redgrave. Krapp's Last Tape is one of the most moving and well loved of Beckett's stage plays. In less then an hour, the dramatist lays bare a whole life in a beautifully constructed work, full of bleak humour, anger and the throbbing ache of lost love. An eccentric old man settles down to record a tape on his 69 th birthday, a ritual he has performed every year. Before he starts, he listens back to his earlier self, aged 39, and reflects on past aspirations, dreams and romances. April 2006 is the centenary of Samuel Beckett's birth. One of the greatest 20 th century writers, Beckett is a fascinating and wholly original voice in world drama. His vision and interpretation of life were both bold and challenging. He was also wildly funny, scattering his often very serious and challenging writing with crisp, wicked Irish wit. It is ironic perhaps to celebrate Beckett's birthday with a piece that ultimately looks at the approach of death. However, it is a masterful play and although written for the stage, the language and structure lend themselves to the intimate experience of radio.

Narrated by Fionnula Flanagan, starring Colm Meaney (Mr. O'Brien of Star Trek: The Next Generation) as Murphy, and featuring 20 of the finest English and Irish voices in the world. Written in English and later translated by Beckett into French, Beckett\u2019s second novel was rejected by over forty publishers. Murphy is by its own admission a puppet show, in which Menippean characters with prodigious vocabularies deal with the absurd costs of living: insanity, lust, and love. Despite his stout Irish everyman\u2019s name, Murphy himself is not a puppet, but a consciousness in crisis: Murphy\u2019s mind pictured itself as a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without. This was not an impoverishment, for it excluded nothing that it did not itself contain. Nothing ever had been, was or would be in the universe outside it but was already present as virtual, or actual, or virtual rising into actual, or actual falling into virtual, in the universe inside it. This \u201cseedy solipsist\u201d is driven into action (such as it is) by a horoscope his lover, Celia Kelly, procures at his request: among other things, it advises him to wear lemon as a lucky colour, to place faith in the years 1936 and 1990, and to take great care \u201cin dealing with publishers, quadrupeds, and tropical swamps.\u201d At Celia\u2019s urging and in a notably reluctant and listless manner, Murphy casts about London for a job, eventually finding a real vocation as a nurse at the Magdalen Mental Mercyseat (called the MMM). Unfortunately for Celia and the other characters looking for him, Murphy finds the catatonia of the MMM\u2019s patients, especially the oblivion of Mr. Endon, supremely attractive \u2013 an alternative to consciousness and its attendant pains and inconveniences. After surrendering to him in chess, Murphy stares into his own reflection in Mr. Endon\u2019s unseeing eyes and, thus blessed, retires to his garret in the MMM and \u201csoon his body was quiet.\u201d Perhaps the \u201cexcellent gas\u201d from the heater kills him before his final immolation. Murphy is a funny and precocious book, but also, it must be said, a mean one. There is a quintessential pointlessness to all its characters\u2019 endeavours, with the notable exception of the search for oblivion, which of course needs not to be sought to be eventually encountered. The schemes of Neary, Wylie, and Miss Counihan get nowhere. Cooper does manage to sit down and remove his hat, but he ultimately relapses into drink. Despite his wishes to have his remains flushed down the toilet, Murphy\u2019s ashes are scattered about in a barfight. Celia grimly returns to prostitution. (Indeed, this book of all Beckett\u2019s works shows least sympathy for women, to put it mildly.) Only Mr. Kelly\u2019s kite achieves transcendence, in what might be the book\u2019s most beautiful and terrifying passage: Except for the sagging soar of line, undoubtedly superb as far as it went, there was nothing to be seen, for the kite had disappeared from view. Mr. Kelly was enraptured. Now he could measure the distance from the unseen to the seen, now he was in a position to determine the point at which seen and unseen met. It would be an unscientific observation, so many and so fitful were the imponderables involved. But the pleasure accruing to Mr. Kelly would be in no way inferior to that conferred (presumably) on Mr. Adams by his beautiful deduction of Neptune from Uranus.

Narrated by Fionnula Flanagan, starring Colm Meaney (Mr. O'Brien of Star Trek: The Next Generation) as Murphy, and featuring 20 of the finest English and Irish voices in the world. Written in English and later translated by Beckett into French, Beckett\u2019s second novel was rejected by over forty publishers. Murphy is by its own admission a puppet show, in which Menippean characters with prodigious vocabularies deal with the absurd costs of living: insanity, lust, and love. Despite his stout Irish everyman\u2019s name, Murphy himself is not a puppet, but a consciousness in crisis: Murphy\u2019s mind pictured itself as a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without. This was not an impoverishment, for it excluded nothing that it did not itself contain. Nothing ever had been, was or would be in the universe outside it but was already present as virtual, or actual, or virtual rising into actual, or actual falling into virtual, in the universe inside it. This \u201cseedy solipsist\u201d is driven into action (such as it is) by a horoscope his lover, Celia Kelly, procures at his request: among other things, it advises him to wear lemon as a lucky colour, to place faith in the years 1936 and 1990, and to take great care \u201cin dealing with publishers, quadrupeds, and tropical swamps.\u201d At Celia\u2019s urging and in a notably reluctant and listless manner, Murphy casts about London for a job, eventually finding a real vocation as a nurse at the Magdalen Mental Mercyseat (called the MMM). Unfortunately for Celia and the other characters looking for him, Murphy finds the catatonia of the MMM\u2019s patients, especially the oblivion of Mr. Endon, supremely attractive \u2013 an alternative to consciousness and its attendant pains and inconveniences. After surrendering to him in chess, Murphy stares into his own reflection in Mr. Endon\u2019s unseeing eyes and, thus blessed, retires to his garret in the MMM and \u201csoon his body was quiet.\u201d Perhaps the \u201cexcellent gas\u201d from the heater kills him before his final immolation. Murphy is a funny and precocious book, but also, it must be said, a mean one. There is a quintessential pointlessness to all its characters\u2019 endeavours, with the notable exception of the search for oblivion, which of course needs not to be sought to be eventually encountered. The schemes of Neary, Wylie, and Miss Counihan get nowhere. Cooper does manage to sit down and remove his hat, but he ultimately relapses into drink. Despite his wishes to have his remains flushed down the toilet, Murphy\u2019s ashes are scattered about in a barfight. Celia grimly returns to prostitution. (Indeed, this book of all Beckett\u2019s works shows least sympathy for women, to put it mildly.) Only Mr. Kelly\u2019s kite achieves transcendence, in what might be the book\u2019s most beautiful and terrifying passage: Except for the sagging soar of line, undoubtedly superb as far as it went, there was nothing to be seen, for the kite had disappeared from view. Mr. Kelly was enraptured. Now he could measure the distance from the unseen to the seen, now he was in a position to determine the point at which seen and unseen met. It would be an unscientific observation, so many and so fitful were the imponderables involved. But the pleasure accruing to Mr. Kelly would be in no way inferior to that conferred (presumably) on Mr. Adams by his beautiful deduction of Neptune from Uranus. He fixed with his eagle eyes a point in the empty sky where he fancied the kite to swim into view, and wound carefully in. Mr. Kelly\u2019s kite then escapes in much the same way that Murphy has slipped out of the puppet show: by crossing from one realm to the other, from the seen to the unseen. It is not exactly death that is the release here, but simply not being, which so often in Beckett means not being seen.
