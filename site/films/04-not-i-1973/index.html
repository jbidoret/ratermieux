<p>1973<br />
Starring and Introduced by Billie Whitelaw</p>
<p>Not I takes place in a pitch black space illuminated only by a single beam of light. This light illuminates an actress's mouth. The mouth utters a monologue of fragmented, jumbled sentences which gradually coelesces into a narrative about a woman who has suffered an unpleasant experience. The title comes from the character's repeated insistence that the events she describes did not happen to her.</p>
<p>The stage directions also call for a character called 'the Auditor' who wears a black robe and can be dimly seen at the back of the stage, occasionally raising its hands in a gesture of impatience. When Beckett came to be involved in staging the play, he found that he was unable to place the Auditor in a stage position that pleased him, and consequently allowed the character to be omitted from those productions. However, he did not decide to cut the character from the published script, and whether or not the character is used in production seems to be at the discretion of individual producers. As he wrote to two American directors in 1986: "He is very difficult to stage (light--position) and may well be of more harm than good. For me the play needs him but I can do without him. I have never seen him function effectively." </p>

<p>Not I</p>
<p>By Samuel Beckett
Written in English in spring 1972. First performed at the Forum Theater of 
the Lincoln Center, New York, in September 1972. First published by Faber and 
Faber, London, in 1973. First performed in Britain at the Royal Court Theatre, 
London, on 16 January 1973.</p>
<p>Note:
Movement: this consists in simple sideways raising of arms from sides and their 
falling back, in a gesture of helpless compassion. It lessens with each recurrence 
till scarcely perceptible at third. There is just enough pause to contain it 
as MOUTH recovers from vehement refusal to relinquish third person.</p>
<p>Stage in darkness but for MOUTH, upstage audience right, about 8 feet above 
stage level, faintly lit from close-up and below, rest of face in shadow. Invisible 
microphone.</p>
<p>AUDITOR, downstage audience left, tall standing figure, sex undeterminable, 
enveloped from head to foot in loose black djellaba, with hood, fully faintly 
lit, standing on invisible podium about 4 feet high shown by attitude alone 
to be facing diagonally across stage intent on MOUTH, dead still throughout 
but for four brief movements where indicated. See Note.
As house lights down MOUTH`S voice unintelligible behind curtain. House lights 
out. Voice continues unintelligible behind curtain, l0 seconds. With rise of 
curtain ad-libbing from text as required leading when curtain fully up and attention 
sufficient into:</p>
<p>MOUTH: . . . . out . . . into this world . . . this world . . . tiny little 
thing . . . before its time . . . in a godfor– . . . what? . . girl? . 
. yes . . . tiny little girl . . . into this . . . out into this . . . before 
her time . . . godforsaken hole called . . . called . . . no matter . . . parents 
unknown . . . unheard of . . . he having vanished . . . thin air . . . no sooner 
buttoned up his breeches . . . she similarly . . . eight months later . . . 
almost to the tick . . . so no love . . . spared that . . . no love such as 
normally vented on the . . . speechless infant . . . in the home . . . no . 
. . nor indeed for that matter any of any kind . . . no love of any kind . . 
. at any subsequent stage . . . so typical affair . . . nothing of any note 
till coming up to sixty when– . . . what? . . seventy?. . good God! . . 
coming up to seventy . . . wandering in a field . . . looking aimlessly for 
cowslips . . . to make a ball . . . a few steps then stop . . . stare into space 
. . . then on . . . a few more . . . stop and stare again . . . so on . . . 
drifting around . . . when suddenly . . . gradually . . . all went out . . . 
all that early April morning light . . . and she found herself in the--– 
. . . what? . . who? . . no! . . she! . . [Pause and movement 1.] . . 
. found herself in the dark . . . and if not exactly . . . insentient . . . 
insentient . . . for she could still hear the buzzing . . . so-called . . . 
in the ears . . . and a ray of light came and went . . . came and went . . . 
such as the moon might cast . . . drifting . . . in and out of cloud . . . but 
so dulled . . . feeling . . . feeling so dulled . . . she did not know . . . 
what position she was in . . . imagine! . . what position she was in! . . whether 
standing . . . or sitting . . . but the brain– . . . what?. . kneeling? 
. . yes . . . whether standing . . . or sitting . . . or kneeling . . . but 
the brain– . . . what? . . lying? . . yes . . whether standing . . . or 
sitting . . . or kneeling . . . or lying . . . but the brain still . . . still 
. . . in a way . . . for her first thought was . . . oh long after . . . sudden 
flash . . . brought up as she had been to believe . . . with the other waifs 
. . . in a merciful . . . [Brief laugh.] . . . God . . . [Good laugh.] 
. . . first thought was . . . oh long after . . . sudden flash . . . she was 
being punished . . . for her sins . . . a number of which then . . . further 
proof if proof were needed . . . flashed through her mind . . . one after another 
. . . then dismissed as foolish . . . oh long after . . . this thought dismissed 
. . . as she suddenly realized . . . gradually realized . . . she was not suffering 
. . . imagine! . . not suffering! . . indeed could not remember . . . off-hand 
. . . when she had suffered less . . . unless of course she was . . . meant 
to be suffering . . . ha! . . thought to be suffering . . . just as the odd 
time . . . in her life . . . when clearly intended to be having pleasure . . 
. she was in fact . . . having none . . . not the slightest . . . in which case 
of course . . . that notion of punishment . . . for some sin or other . . . 
or for the lot . . . or no particular reason . . . for its own sake . . . thing 
she understood perfectly . . . that notion of punishment . . . which had first 
occurred to her . . . brought up as she had been to believe . . . with the other 
waifs . . . in a merciful . . . [Brief laugh.] . . . God . . . [Good 
laugh.] . . . first occurred to her . . . then dismissed . . . as foolish 
. . . was perhaps not so foolish . . . after all . . . so on . . . all that 
. . . vain reasonings . . . till another thought . . . oh long after . . . sudden 
flash . . . . . very foolish really but– . . . what? . . the buzzing? . 
. yes . . . all the time buzzing . . . so-called . . . in the ears . . . though 
of course actually . . . not in the ears at all . . . in the skull . . . dull 
roar in the skull . . . and all the time this ray or beam . . . like moonbeam 
. . . but probably not . . . certainly not . . . always the same spot . . . 
now bright . . . now shrouded . . . but always the same spot . . . as no moon 
could . . . no . . . no moon . . . just all part of the same wish to . . . torment 
. . . though actually in point of fact . . . not in the least . . . not a twinge 
. . . so far . . . ha! . . so far . . . this other thought then . . . oh long 
after . . . sudden flash . . . very foolish really but so like her . . . in 
a way . . . that she might do well to . . . groan . . . on and off . . . writhe 
she could not . . . as if in actual agony . . . but could not . . . could not 
bring herself . . . some flaw in her make-up . . . incapable of deceit . . . 
or the machine . . . more likely the machine . . . so disconnected . . . never 
got the message . . . or powerless to respond . . . like numbed . . . couldn't 
make the sound . . . not any sound . . . no sound of any kind . . . no screaming 
for help for example . . . should she feel so inclined . . . scream . . . [Screams.] 
. . . then listen . . . [Silence.] . . . scream again . . . [Screams 
again.] . . . then listen again . . . [Silence.] . . . no . . . spared 
that . . . all silent as the grave . . . no part–. . . what? . . the buzzing? 
. . yes . . . all silent but for the buzzing . . . so-called . . . no part of 
her moving . . . that she could feel . . . just the eyelids . . . presumably 
. . . on and off . . . shut out the light . . . reflex they call it . . . no 
feeling of any kind . . . but the lids . . . even best of times . . . who feels 
them? . . opening . . . shutting . . . all that moisture . . .but the brain 
still . . . still sufficiently . . . oh very much so! . . at this stage . . 
. in control . . . under control . . . to question even this . . . for on that 
April morning . . . so it reasoned . . . that April morning . . . she fixing 
with her eye . . . a distant bell . . . as she hastened towards it . . . fixing 
it with her eye . . . lest it elude her . . . had not all gone out . . . all 
that light . . . of itself . . . without any . . . any. . . on her part . . 
. so on . . . so on it reasoned . . . vain questionings . . . and all dead still 
. . . sweet silent as the grave . . . when suddenly . . . gradually . . . she 
realiz–. . . what? . . the buzzing? . . yes . . . all dead still but for 
the buzzing . . . when suddenly she realized . . . words were– . . . what? 
. . who?. . no! . . she! . . [Pause and movement 2.] . . . realized . 
. . words were coming . . . imagine! . . . words were coming . . . a voice she 
did not recognize at first so long since it had sounded . . . then finally had 
to admit . . . could be none other . . . than her own . . . certain vowel sounds 
. . . she had never heard . . . elsewhere . . . so that people would stare . 
. . the rare occasions . . . once or twice a year . . . always winter some strange 
reason . . . stare at her uncom-prehending . . . and now this stream . . . steady 
stream . . . she who had never . . . on the contrary . . . practically speechless 
. . . all her days . . . how she survived! . . even shopping . . . out shopping 
. . . busy shopping centre . . . supermart . . . just hand in the list . . . 
with the bag . . . old black shopping bag . . . then stand there waiting . . 
. any length of time . . . middle of the throng . . . motionless . . . staring 
into space . . . mouth half open as usual . . . till it 
was back in her hand . . . the bag back in her hand . . . then pay and go . 
. . not as much as good-bye . . . how she survived! . . and now this stream 
. . . not catching the half of it . . . not the quarter . . . no idea . . . 
what she was saying . . . imagine! . . no idea what she was saying! . . till 
she began trying to . . . delude herself . . . it was not hers at all . . . 
not her voice at all . . . and no doubt would have . . . vital she should . 
. . was on the point . . . after long efforts . . . when suddenly she felt . 
. . gradually she felt . . . her lips moving . . . imagine! . . her lips moving! 
. . as of course till then she had not . . . and not alone the lips . . . the 
cheeks . . . the jaws . . . the whole face . . . all those– . . what?. 
. the tongue? . . yes . . . the tongue in the mouth . . . all those contortions 
without which . . . no speech possible . . . and yet in the ordinary way . . 
. not felt at all . . . so intent one is . . . on what one is saying . . . the 
whole being . . . hanging on its words . . . so that not only she had . . . 
had she . . . not only had she . . . to give up . . . admit hers alone . . . 
her voice alone . . . but this other awful thought . . . oh long after . . . 
sudden flash . . . even more awful if possible . . . that feeling was coming 
back . . . imagine! . . feeling coming back! . . starting at the top . . . then 
working down . . . the whole machine . . . but no . . . spared that . . . the 
mouth alone . . . so far . . . ha! . . so far . . . then thinking . . . oh long 
after . . . sudden flash . . . it can't go on . . . all this . . . all that 
. . . steady stream . . . straining to hear . . . make some-thing of it . . 
. and her own thoughts . . . make something of them . . . all– . . . what? 
. . the buzzing? . . yes . . . all the time the buzzing . . . so-called . . 
. all that together . . . imagine! . . whole body like gone . . . just the mouth 
. . . lips . . . cheeks . . . jaws . . . never– . . . what?. . tongue? 
. . yes . . . lips. . . cheeks . . . jaws . . . tongue . . . never still a second 
. . . mouth on fire . . . stream of words . . . in her ear . . . practically 
in her ear . . . not catching the half . . . not the quarter . . . no idea what 
she's saying . . . imagine! . . no idea what she's saying! . . and can't stop 
. . . no stopping it . . . she who but a moment before . . . but a moment! . 
. could not make a sound . . . no sound of any kind . . . now can't stop . . 
. imagine! . . can't stop the stream . . . and the whole brain begging . . . 
something begging in the brain . . . begging the mouth to stop . . . pause a 
moment . . . if only for a moment . . . and no response . . . as if it hadn’t 
heard . . . or couldn’t . . . couldn't pause a second . . . like maddened 
. . . all that together . . . straining to hear . . . piece it together . . 
. and the brain . . . raving away on its own . . . trying to make sense of it 
. . . or make it stop . . . or in the past . . . dragging up the past . . . 
flashes from all over . . . walks mostly . . . walking all her days . . . day 
after day . . . a few steps then stop . . . stare into space . . . then on . 
. . a few more . . . stop and stare again . . . so on . . . drifting around 
. . . day after day . . . or that time she cried . . . the one time she could 
remember . . . since she was a baby . . . must have cried as a baby . . . perhaps 
not . . . not essential to life . . . just the birth cry to get her going . 
. . breathing . . . then no more till this . . . old hag already . . . sitting 
staring at her hand . . . where was it? . . Croker's Acres . . . one evening 
on the way home . . . home! . . a little mound in Croker's Acres . . . dusk 
. . . sitting staring at her hand . . . there in her lap . . . palm upward .

. . . no one else for miles . . . no sound . . . just the tears . . . sat and 
watched them dry . . . all over in a second . . . or grabbing at straw . . . 
the brain . . . flickering away on its own . . . quick grab and on. . . nothing 
there . . . on to the next . . . bad as the voice . . . worse . . . as little 
sense . . . all that together . . . can't– . . . what? . . the buzzing? 
. . yes . . . all the time the buzzing . . . dull roar like falls . . . and 
the beam . . . flickering on and off . . . starting to move around . . . like 
moonbeam but not . . . all part of the same . . . keep an eye on that too .

. . . in the skull . . . and the beam . . . ferreting around . . . painless 
. . . so far . . . ha! . . so far . . . then thinking . . . oh long after .
